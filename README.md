# ActinoMation
My PhD project revolving laboratory automation of actinomycetes (mostly streptomyces) using OT2 and JupyterNotebook via literate programming.


Installation guide:
All of the .py scripts will need to be in a folder for itself included with the __init__.py file. This folder will have to be named "python_scripts".

Dependencies so far found necessary to install, if not run through Anaconda Jupyter Notebook, are:

- ipywidgets
- opentrons
- pyisemail
- xlsxwriter

To install it through the notebook, write the following code:
!pip install ipywidgets
!pip install opentrons
!pip install pyisemail
!pip install xlsxwriter

Remove the "!" if in terminal.

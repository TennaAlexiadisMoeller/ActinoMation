# ActinoMation: Automated Medium-Throughput Conjugation for Streptomyces spp.
My PhD project revolving laboratory automation of actinomycetes (mostly streptomyces) via literate programming.

## Description
This repository provides an open-source workflow for the automation of Streptomyces conjugation, leveraging the Opentrons 2 platform and literate programming in Jupyter Notebooks. Developed to address the challenges in Streptomyces transformation, our system combines heat-shock transformation of E. coli with conjugation protocols for Streptomyces spp., including S. coelicolor, S. albidoflavus, and S. venezuelae. This approach streamlines repetitive procedures, minimizes human error, and enables scalable experiments.

The Jupyter Notebooks serve as interactive guides, allowing users to specify experimental parameters through an intuitive GUI. Outputs include Python scripts for the Opentrons robot, Excel files with consumable requirements, and detailed metadata logs. By providing adaptable protocols and modular setups, this repository supports laboratories in automating medium-throughput workflows without the need for extensive programming knowledge or costly biofoundry equipment.

For setup details, protocol instructions, and troubleshooting, please see the documentation within the notebooks.
